Problem: [{'input': [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]}, {'input': [[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]}]

Observations:
openai/o1-mini: **Observations & Hints for Deriving the Transformation Function:**

1. **Horizontal and Vertical Propagation Patterns:**
   - **Expansion Along Axes:** Notice how certain non-zero elements (like `1` and `2`) in the input grids extend horizontally or vertically in the output grids. This suggests that the transformation might involve propagating these values along specific axes or in their immediate surroundings.
   - **Selective Directionality:** The propagation doesn't uniformly spread in all directions. For instance, in some cases, values extend primarily downward or sideways, indicating potential directional rules based on the position or type of the original value.

2. **Layered Influence with Multiple Value Types:**
   - **Hierarchical Value Impact:** Different numerical values seem to influence transformations differently. For example, `2`s might have a broader propagation effect compared to `1`s, which appear to duplicate or maintain their positions. This layered influence hints at a hierarchy where certain values dictate the transformation behaviors more dominantly.
   - **Interaction Among Values:** The presence of multiple non-zero values within the same grid could lead to overlapping or interacting transformation rules, where one value's propagation might affect or limit another's expansion.

3. **Row-Specific Transformation Rules:**
   - **Immutable Rows:** Rows filled with a single repeated value (e.g., all `5`s) remain unchanged in the output, suggesting that uniform rows might be treated as boundaries or fixed layers that influence adjacent row transformations without altering themselves.
   - **Sequential Row Dependencies:** Transformation in one row appears to depend on the state of adjacent rows. For instance, modifications in row `n` might trigger changes in row `n+1` or `n-1`, indicating a sequential or iterative transformation process across rows.

4. **Boundary and Edge Cell Treatments:**
   - **Edge Preservation or Modification:** Cells at the grid's boundaries exhibit specific transformation behaviors, such as limited propagation or deliberate value retention. This could imply that edge cells are governed by unique rules to prevent overflow or to maintain grid integrity.
   - **Corner Case Handling:** Corners might serve as pivotal points for initiating or limiting propagation, influencing how transformations spread from these extreme positions compared to more central cells.

5. **Consistency and Replication of Existing Patterns:**
   - **Mirror Imaging:** Some transformations reflect existing patterns symmetrically across the grid, suggesting that the function might enforce or replicate symmetrical properties based on the input configuration.
   - **Pattern Continuity:** Existing sequences or clusters of non-zero values tend to continue or expand in a consistent manner, indicating that the transformation maintains or extends existing patterns rather than introducing entirely new ones.

6. **Incremental and Conditional Value Assignments:**
   - **Conditional Value Changes:** The assignment of new values in the output grid isn't arbitrary but depends on specific conditions derived from the input grid, such as the presence of particular neighboring values or relative positions.
   - **Incremental Value Adjustments:** In some scenarios, values might increment or adjust based on their adjacency to other values, hinting at a rule-based system where transformations consider incremental changes rather than wholesale replacements.

7. **Symbiotic Row Interdependencies:**
   - **Influence Across Multiple Rows:** Transformations in one row might simultaneously affect multiple other rows, indicating that the function operates with a broader perspective, possibly considering multi-row contexts to determine the appropriate transformations.
   - **Feedback Loops Between Rows:** There may be feedback mechanisms where changes in a lower row influence upper rows and vice versa, creating a dynamic transformation environment that balances changes across the entire grid.

8. **Preservation of Core Structures Amidst Transformation:**
   - **Retention of Central Elements:** Key structural elements, such as centrally placed non-zero values or uniformly filled rows, remain largely intact or undergo minimal changes, suggesting that the transformation respects and preserves foundational grid structures.
   - **Selective Transformation Focus:** The function might prioritize transforming specific regions or value types while leaving others untouched, indicating a targeted approach to grid manipulation based on predefined criteria.

9. **Implicit Role of Grid Coordinates:**
   - **Positional Influence:** The row and column indices of each cell likely play a role in determining its transformation, implying that the function may incorporate the cell's coordinates as part of its transformation logic.
   - **Spatial Relationships:** The relative positioning of non-zero values (e.g., alignment, distance) could influence how transformations are applied, suggesting that spatial relationships within the grid are integral to deriving the transformation function.

10. **Dynamic Adaptation Based on Grid Content:**
    - **Content-Driven Transformation Rules:** The specific arrangement and types of non-zero values within the input grid appear to dynamically influence the transformation rules, indicating that the function adapts its behavior based on the current grid state rather than following a rigid, static set of rules.
    - **Scalability with Grid Complexity:** As the input grids contain varying complexities and distributions of non-zero values, the transformation function likely scales its operations to accommodate and respond appropriately to differing levels of grid intricacy.

These observations aim to highlight intricate patterns and underlying rules that govern the transformation from input grids to output grids. By focusing on propagation behaviors, value hierarchies, row dependencies, and spatial relationships, you can develop a nuanced approach to deduce the precise function responsible for these grid transformations.
