Prompt:  Here are a few examlpes of input-output grid pairs where the objective is to derive a function that can transform each input_grid to the corresponding output_grid. Return several useful, non-obvious, and correct observations about the problem, like hints to solve the problem. Do NOT return any code. Be as creative as possible, going beyond what you think is intuitively correct.

Problem: [{'input': [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]}, {'input': [[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]}]

Observations:
openai/o1-mini: **Observations:**

1. **Immutable Uniform Rows:**
   - **Pattern Preservation:** Rows entirely composed of the number `5` remain unchanged in the output. This suggests that the transformation respects uniform rows, possibly treating them as fixed boundaries or barriers that prevent alterations in adjacent cells.
   - **Potential Significance of `5`:** The number `5` might serve a special role, such as representing obstacles, floors, or areas immune to modification, indicating that the function selectively targets only certain cell values for transformation.

2. **Vertical Propagation of `2`s:**
   - **Column-Wise Extension:** In both examples, existing `2`s in the input grids lead to additional `2`s being placed vertically aligned in the output. This vertical streaking implies that the transformation favors upward and/or downward expansion from original `2` positions.
   - **Boundary Influence:** The propagation of `2`s doesn't breach the grid's top or bottom edges, indicating that boundary conditions are handled gracefully, perhaps by halting expansion at the grid limits.

3. **Horizontal Augmentation of `1`s:**
   - **Row-Wide Duplication:** `1`s in the input often result in additional `1`s horizontally adjacent in the output. This horizontal replication suggests that `1`s have an inherent tendency to extend sideways, possibly forming or reinforcing linear structures.
   - **Interplay with `2`s:** The horizontal spread of `1`s occurs independently of the vertical spread of `2`s, indicating that different numbers influence distinct directional transformations within the grid.

4. **Selective Cell Transformation:**
   - **Non-Uniform Alteration:** Only specific `0`s transform into `1`s or `2`s based on their positions relative to existing non-zero cells. This selective behavior implies that the transformation relies on local context, such as proximity to certain numbers or patterns, rather than applying a uniform change across the entire grid.
   - **Edge Cell Considerations:** Cells at the grid's borders exhibit unique transformation behaviors, suggesting that edge cells are treated differently, possibly to maintain grid integrity or avoid out-of-bounds issues.

5. **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Outcomes:**
   - **Emergence of Symmetry:** While the input grids display a mix of symmetric and asymmetric patterns, the outputs often enhance symmetry, especially vertically. This indicates that the transformation might prioritize creating or emphasizing symmetrical structures based on the initial configuration.
   - **Asymmetric Inputs Yielding Symmetric Outputs:** Even when inputs have asymmetric distributions of `1`s and `2`s, the outputs exhibit more balanced and mirrored placements, hinting at underlying rules that drive towards equilibrium or balance in the grid.

6. **Layered Influence Zones:**
   - **Multiple Transformation Layers:** The presence of both `1`s and `2`s suggests that the transformation operates on multiple layers or priority levels. For instance, `2`s might have a higher priority, causing their propagation to occur before or in tandem with `1`s, leading to complex interaction zones where both numbers influence the final state.
   - **Overlapping Influence Areas:** In regions where `1`s and `2`s are in proximity, their respective transformation behaviors could overlap, resulting in nuanced patterns that reflect the combined effects of both numbers.

7. **Preservation of Original Non-Zero Cells:**
   - **Original Data Retention:** All non-zero cells in the input (i.e., `1`s, `2`s, and `5`s) are preserved in the output, either maintaining their original value or being complemented by additional numbers. This suggests that the transformation does not overwrite existing non-zero data but builds upon it, ensuring the foundational structure remains intact.
   - **Augmenting Without Overwriting:** The function likely focuses on augmentation—adding new `1`s and `2`s around existing ones—without removing or altering the original non-zero cells, thereby preserving essential features of the initial grid.

8. **Interaction with Central and Peripheral Regions:**
   - **Centralized vs. Peripheral Transformation:** The transformation appears more pronounced in central areas of the grid, where multiple `2`s and `1`s can influence each other, while peripheral regions may see limited changes unless directly adjacent to active cells. This could imply that the function prioritizes transformations based on cell density or centrality.
   - **Edge Minimal Changes Unless Influenced:** Peripheral areas only undergo transformation when influenced by central active cells, indicating that peripheral `0`s remain largely untouched unless specific conditions are met, such as adjacency to a `1` or `2`.

9. **Consistency Across Multiple Iterations:**
   - **Scalability of Rules:** Given that both examples show similar patterns of `2` and `1` propagation, it suggests that the underlying transformation rules are consistent and scalable, capable of handling various initial configurations while producing predictable expansion patterns.
   - **Rule-Based Expansion:** The transformation likely adheres to strict, rule-based logic that can be uniformly applied across different grid states, ensuring that similar input patterns yield analogous output modifications regardless of their specific locations.

10. **Potential Role of Proximity and Alignment:**
    - **Neighbor-Dependent Changes:** The placement of new `1`s and `2`s seems to depend on the proximity to existing non-zero cells, possibly influenced by alignment (vertical for `2`s and horizontal for `1`s). This indicates that the transformation function might evaluate neighboring cells to determine where and how to apply changes.
    - **Alignment-Based Priority:** The directional alignment of transformations (vertical vs. horizontal) based on the number type (`2` vs. `1`) points to a nuanced priority system within the function, where certain directions are favored for specific numbers to create coherent and structured output patterns.

These observations aim to shed light on the underlying mechanics of the transformation function by highlighting patterns, propagation behaviors, and conditional rules evident in the input-output grid pairs. Leveraging these insights can guide the derivation of the function by focusing on immutable structures, directional expansions, selective transformations, and the interactions between different numerical influences within the grid.

Prompt:  You are an expert Python programmer. Here are a few examlpes of input-outputgrid pairs where the objective is to derive a function that can transform each input_grid to the corresponding output_grid.

Alignment-Based Priority: The directional alignment of transformations (vertical vs. horizontal) based on the number type (`2` vs. `1`) points to a nuanced priority system within the function, where certain directions are favored for specific numbers to create coherent and structured output patterns.

New observations:
openai/o1-mini: **New Observations:**

1. **Diagonal Influence Propagation:**
   - *Potential Diagonal Spread:* Although vertical and horizontal propagations of `2`s and `1`s are evident, there's an implicit absence or minimal impact of diagonal spreads. This suggests that the transformation function either restricts influence to orthogonal directions or applies diagonal propagation under specific conditions, such as the presence of certain neighboring values.
   - *Conditional Diagonal Activation:* In scenarios where diagonal neighbors contain specific values (e.g., a `2` adjacent diagonally to another `2`), the transformation might activate diagonal propagation, leading to sporadic diagonal streaks within the grid.

2. **Hierarchical Priority Between Numbers:**
   - *Priority-Based Overlapping:* When `1`s and `2`s are in close proximity, there may be a priority system where one number's transformation rules take precedence over the other. For instance, `2`s might inhibit or override the horizontal spread of `1`s in overlapping regions, resulting in distinct patterning where `2`s dominate.
   - *Conflict Resolution Mechanism:* The transformation likely incorporates a mechanism to resolve conflicts when multiple influence rules apply to the same cell, determining which number (if any) should be placed based on predefined hierarchical rules.

3. **Transformation Saturation Points:**
   - *Limit on Propagation Depth:* There's an implicit cap on how far `2`s and `1`s can propagate from their original positions. This saturation point ensures that the transformation doesn't endlessly expand, maintaining a balanced density of non-zero values across the grid.
   - *Gradient-Based Limiting:* The transformation might employ gradient thresholds where the influence diminishes beyond a certain distance, preventing excessive or sparse distributions of `2`s and `1`s.

4. **Localized Cluster Formation:**
   - *Formation of Clusters Around Actives:* Non-zero cells (`1`s and `2`s) tend to form localized clusters rather than uniformly dispersing across the grid. This clustering behavior suggests that the transformation rules encourage the grouping of similar numbers, potentially leading to compact regions of influence.
   - *Buffer Zones Between Clusters:* The presence of buffer zones—areas of `0`s between clusters—indicates that the transformation not only promotes clustering but also maintains separation to preserve distinct active regions.

5. **Adaptive Transformation Based on Cell Density:**
   - *Density-Responsive Rules:* The transformation function may adapt its behavior based on the local density of non-zero cells. In high-density areas, the propagation of `2`s and `1`s could accelerate or saturate more quickly, while in low-density regions, the changes might be more restrained or gradual.
   - *Inhibition in High-Density Areas:* Alternatively, high-density clusters might inhibit further propagation to prevent overcrowding, ensuring a balanced distribution across the grid.

6. **Directional Bias Introduction:**
   - *Introduction of Preferred Directions Beyond Initial Patterns:* While vertical and horizontal propagations are primary, the transformation might introduce subtle directional biases based on the overall grid layout or existing patterns, leading to emergent directional flows within the grid.
   - *Influence of Grid Orientation:* The transformation could be sensitive to the grid’s orientation or symmetry, adjusting propagation directions to enhance or disrupt existing alignments.

7. **Temporal Consistency and State Memory:**
   - *State Retention Across Transformations:* If the transformation is applied iteratively, the function may retain certain state information from previous iterations, influencing current transformations based on historical data rather than purely the immediate grid state.
   - *Progressive Pattern Evolution:* This state memory could lead to progressively evolving patterns that build upon prior transformations, resulting in more complex and dynamic structures over multiple iterations.

8. **Boundary Condition Sensitivity:**
   - *Variable Transformation Rules at Edges and Corners:* Cells located at the grid's boundaries or corners might be subject to distinct transformation rules, such as limited propagation directions or altered propagation strengths, ensuring that edge conditions don't disrupt the overall transformation logic.
   - *Edge-Defined Reflection or Termination:* The transformation could employ reflection logic at the boundaries, mirroring propagation patterns inward, or outright terminating influence extensions to maintain grid integrity.

9. **Probabilistic Transformation Elements:**
   - *Incorporation of Randomness in Cell Transformation:* Beyond deterministic rules, the transformation might include probabilistic elements where certain cells have a calculated chance to transform based on their surroundings, introducing variability and reducing pattern predictability.
   - *Stochastic Influence Adjustments:* This randomness can help in avoiding overly uniform patterns, fostering more natural and varied distributions of `1`s and `2`s.

10. **Inverse Relationship Between `1`s and `2`s:**
    - *Compensatory Transformation Dynamics:* There may exist an inverse relationship where the presence or propagation of `1`s limits or inversely affects the propagation of `2`s, and vice versa. This dynamic ensures a balanced interplay, preventing one number from overwhelmingly dominating the grid.
    - *Dynamic Equilibrium Maintenance:* Such compensatory mechanisms help in maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between different non-zero values, fostering diverse and intricate patterns.

11. **Influence of Initial Non-Zero Density on Transformation Intensity:**
    - *Higher Initial Density Leads to More Intense Transformation:* Grids with a higher initial number of `1`s and `2`s might experience more pronounced transformations, with more extensive propagation and augmentation compared to sparser initial configurations.
    - *Transformation Scaling Based on Initial Conditions:* The intensity and reach of transformation rules could scale proportionally with the initial density of active cells, allowing the function to adapt its behavior based on the input grid's complexity.

12. **Symmetry Enforcement Beyond Initial Patterns:**
    - *Active Symmetrization:* Even if the input lacks complete symmetry, the transformation may enforce or enhance symmetry during propagation, creating mirrored or rotationally symmetric patterns in the output.
    - *Preference for Certain Symmetric Axes:* The transformation might prioritize specific axes (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) for symmetry enforcement, influencing the overall structural alignment of the output grid.

13. **Layered Transformation Phases:**
    - *Sequential Application of Transformation Rules:* The function may apply transformation rules in distinct phases or layers, such as first propagating `2`s and then `1`s, or vice versa. This layering can create layered patterns where different numbers occupy distinct spatial zones based on transformation sequencing.
    - *Interleaved Rule Applications for Complexity:* Alternating or interleaving transformation phases can introduce complexity, allowing the emergence of intricate patterns that result from the interplay of sequential rule applications.

14. **Transformation Rate Modulation Based on Surrounding Cells:**
    - *Variable Propagation Rates:* The rate at which `1`s and `2`s propagate may vary depending on the surrounding cell configurations, such as accelerating in open spaces or decelerating near clusters.
    - *Environmental Adaptation:* This modulation allows the transformation to adapt to the local "environment" within the grid, leading to more nuanced and context-sensitive pattern formations.

15. **Feedback Mechanisms Influencing Transformation Behavior:**
    - *Self-Regulating Transformation Processes:* The transformation function might incorporate feedback loops where the presence of certain patterns or densities influences subsequent transformation rules, enabling self-regulation and adaptive pattern generation.
    - *Dynamic Adjustment of Influence Strengths:* Feedback mechanisms can dynamically adjust the strengths of `1` and `2` propagations based on ongoing pattern developments, fostering responsive and evolving grid states.

16. **Emergence of Higher-Order Patterns and Structures:**
    - *Formation of Complex Structures:* Beyond simple propagation, the transformation might facilitate the emergence of higher-order patterns such as grids within grids, concentric shapes, or interconnected networks of `1`s and `2`s.
    - *Pattern Hierarchies:* There may be hierarchical relationships where smaller patterns aggregate into larger, more complex structures, guided by the transformation rules' inherent tendencies.

17. **Localized Transformation Intensifiers or Dampeners:**
    - *Presence of Modifier Cells:* Specific cell values or configurations might act as intensifiers or dampeners, enhancing or reducing the transformation's impact in their vicinity. For example, an extra `2` in a region could amplify vertical propagation, while a cluster of `1`s might dampen horizontal spread.
    - *Contextual Transformation Influences:* These modifier cells introduce contextual nuances, allowing the transformation to respond dynamically to varying local conditions within the grid.

18. **Asymptotic Behavior Towards Stability:**
    - *Convergence to a Stable State:* Repeated applications of the transformation may lead the grid toward a stable configuration where no further changes occur, indicating that the transformation rules drive the grid toward equilibrium.
    - *Identification of Invariant Structures:* Certain patterns or structures within the grid might become invariant under transformation, serving as anchors or fixed points that guide the overall stability of the grid.

19. **Energy Landscape Interpretation:**
    - *Mapping Transformation to Energy Minimization:* The transformation process could be analogous to an energy minimization problem, where the grid evolves to reduce "energy" by optimizing the distribution of `1`s and `2`s according to specific rules.
    - *Potential Function Guiding Transformation:* An underlying potential function might dictate the direction and nature of transformations, influencing how `1`s and `2`s spread to achieve a balanced or optimized state.

20. **Scalability and Resolution Independence:**
    - *Consistent Transformation Across Different Grid Sizes:* The transformation rules appear to be scalable, maintaining consistent behavior regardless of grid size, suggesting that the function is resolution-independent and can adapt to various grid dimensions without altering its fundamental logic.
    - *Pattern Preservation Across Scales:* Larger or smaller grids subjected to the same transformation rules preserve the relative patterns and proportional distributions of `1`s and `2`s, indicating a robust and versatile transformation mechanism.

These additional observations delve deeper into the potential mechanics and implications of the transformation function, exploring aspects such as directional biases, hierarchical priorities, saturation points, and emergent complex structures. They aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying rules and behaviors governing the input-output grid transformations.

Text: **New Observations:**

1. **Diagonal Influence Propagation:**
   - *Potential Diagonal Spread:* Although vertical and horizontal propagations of `2`s and `1`s are evident, there's an implicit absence or minimal impact of diagonal spreads. This suggests that the transformation function either restricts influence to orthogonal directions or applies diagonal propagation under specific conditions, such as the presence of certain neighboring values.
   - *Conditional Diagonal Activation:* In scenarios where diagonal neighbors contain specific values (e.g., a `2` adjacent diagonally to another `2`), the transformation might activate diagonal propagation, leading to sporadic diagonal streaks within the grid.

2. **Hierarchical Priority Between Numbers:**
   - *Priority-Based Overlapping:* When `1`s and `2`s are in close proximity, there may be a priority system where one number's transformation rules take precedence over the other. For instance, `2`s might inhibit or override the horizontal spread of `1`s in overlapping regions, resulting in distinct patterning where `2`s dominate.
   - *Conflict Resolution Mechanism:* The transformation likely incorporates a mechanism to resolve conflicts when multiple influence rules apply to the same cell, determining which number (if any) should be placed based on predefined hierarchical rules.

3. **Transformation Saturation Points:**

Immutable Uniform Rows: Pattern Preservation: Rows entirely composed of the number `5` remain unchanged in the output. This suggests that the transformation respects uniform rows, possibly treating them as fixed boundaries or barriers that prevent alterations in adjacent cells. Potential Significance of `5`: The number `5` might serve a special role, such as representing obstacles, floors, or areas immune to modification, indicating that the function selectively targets only certain cell values for transformation.

Here are the intelligent observations to help solve the problem:
Vertical Propagation of `2`s: Column-Wise Extension: In both examples, existing `2`s in the input grids lead to additional `2`s being placed vertically aligned in the output. This vertical streaking implies that the transformation favors upward and/or downward expansion from original `2` positions. Boundary Influence: The propagation of `2`s doesn't breach the grid's top or bottom edges, indicating that boundary conditions are handled gracefully, perhaps by halting expansion at the grid limits.

Use these observations above to brainstorm a natural language solution / plan to the problem above. Note that your intuition may lead you astray, so come up with simple, creative ideas that go beyond what you would usually come up with and exceeds your narrow intuition. Quote relevant parts of the observations EXACTLY before each step of the solution. QUOTING IS CRUCIAL.
openai/o1-mini: **Step 1: "Vertical Propagation of `2`s: Column-Wise Extension: In both examples, existing `2`s in the input grids lead to additional `2`s being placed vertically aligned in the output. This vertical streaking implies that the transformation favors upward and/or downward expansion from original `2` positions."**

Begin by identifying all the cells in the input grid that contain the value `2`. These cells are the primary sources from which the vertical propagation will emanate. For each identified `2`, plan to extend its presence vertically, both upwards and downwards, to create a continuous vertical streak of `2`s in the output grid.

**Step 2: "Boundary Influence: The propagation of `2`s doesn't breach the grid's top or bottom edges, indicating that boundary conditions are handled gracefully, perhaps by halting expansion at the grid limits."**

Implement boundary checks to ensure that the vertical propagation of `2`s does not exceed the grid's limits. When extending upwards, ensure that the row index does not become negative, and when extending downwards, ensure it does not surpass the maximum row index of the grid. If a boundary is reached, halt the propagation in that direction to maintain the integrity of the grid.

**Step 3: Analyze Each Column for `2` Presence**

For each column in the grid:
- Scan from the top row to the bottom row to locate all occurrences of `2`.
- For every found `2`, mark its position as the starting point for vertical propagation.

**Step 4: Execute Vertical Propagation for Each Marked `2`**

For each marked `2`:
- **Upward Propagation**: Move upwards one row at a time from the `2`'s position. If the next cell above is within bounds and does not already contain a `2`, set it to `2`. Continue this process until a non-zero value is encountered or the top boundary is reached.
- **Downward Propagation**: Similarly, move downwards one row at a time from the `2`'s position. Apply the same logic as upward propagation, ensuring that propagation stops when a boundary is encountered or an existing `2` is found.

**Step 5: Preserve Non-`2` Cells Unless Affected by Propagation**

Ensure that cells containing values other than `2` (such as `0`, `1`, or `5`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the vertical propagation of a `2`. This maintains the integrity of other elements within the grid.

**Step 6: Compile the Transformed Grid as the Output**

After completing the vertical propagation for all `2`s and respecting boundary conditions, compile the modified grid. This grid should reflect the vertical streaks of `2`s as observed in the output examples, while all other cell values remain consistent with the input unless altered by the propagation rules.

**Step 7: Validate the Transformation with Test Cases**

Finally, apply the transformation process to the provided input examples to verify that the output matches the expected results. This validation ensures that the propagation logic is correctly implemented and adheres to the observed transformation patterns.

Here are the intelligent observations to help solve the problem:
Horizontal Augmentation of `1`s: Row-Wide Duplication: `1`s in the input often result in additional `1`s horizontally adjacent in the output. This horizontal replication suggests that `1`s have an inherent tendency to extend sideways, possibly forming or reinforcing linear structures. Interplay with `2`s: The horizontal spread of `1`s occurs independently of the vertical spread of `2`s, indicating that different numbers influence distinct directional transformations within the grid.

Here are the intelligent observations to help solve the problem:
Selective Cell Transformation: Non-Uniform Alteration: Only specific `0`s transform into `1`s or `2`s based on their positions relative to existing non-zero cells. This selective behavior implies that the transformation relies on local context, such as proximity to certain numbers or patterns, rather than applying a uniform change across the entire grid. Edge Cell Considerations: Cells at the grid's borders exhibit unique transformation behaviors, suggesting that edge cells are treated differently, possibly to maintain grid integrity or avoid out-of-bounds issues.
